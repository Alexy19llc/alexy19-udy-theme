Don’t burden people with grunt work. Sometimes people have to fill out long forms regardless of our best intentions. Make that work as efficient and pleasant as possible. Leverage the device’s characteristic features before creating a unique solution. Don’t reinvent the wheel, but don’t take it for granted either. If others have solved the problem be it a UX pattern or technical implementation, then use it if you have access to it. For an existing solution ask your team if they can improve upon it. Do not use an existing solution wholesale without performing due diligence. Avoid building the wrong thing by [defining the MVP](https://youtu.be/MHJn_SubN4E) through the lens of your users, your resources, and your business goals. The question is, _how much complexity can we offload onto the system?_

A task driven app should create an experience that allows room for the user’s intellect. [Minimize cognitive load](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/) to maximize people’s working memory for important tasks. The question is, _what type of work is best left to our user?_

Provide tolerance limits, but don’t make your turns too tight. The user should understand when they are pushing against the scope of an application,they may have a good reason for doing so. The question is, _how can we help our users avoid pitfalls?_

Beautiful aesthetics improves usability. Make allowances for current trends, but never sacrifice good taste or usability. So-called flat design, the use of simple graphics and pure colors, as opposed to skeuomorphic design, the use of illustrative and representative graphics with deep dimensionality, is the current trend. Flat design’s simplicity is its Achilles’ heel because it lacks important nuance, or what UX designers call [affordance](http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordances_and.html). Use good judgment when deciding on the tone of your work. Do not be a slave to convention whether it is historical precedent or a current trend. Do not be a design imperialist, your ideas can be stretched too far. Your door handle doesn’t need to be a logo.

A bridge too far, aggressive use of branding as a design element

Make discovery a team effort. Try hosting a [Design Studio Workshop](https://workshopper.com), start shipping, and be sure to involve the whole team along the way. Using these guidelines I’ve formed my opinions about, which devices and UIs are most successful and where the market is likely to head. Despite this, it pays to stay aware. People are full of surprises, and the world is full of wonder. Test your ideas by putting them out there early and often. Measure the reaction and use your insightfulness to drive success. The reality is that the best ideas don’t always win, and too often outside forces constrain the market. We shape and build, acknowledging the fact that the world is bigger than our imagination. The future belongs to us and those we are serving. We should measure our opinions by that reality, allowing others to examine our point of view.
