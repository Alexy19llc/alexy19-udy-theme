There is an idea that all that can be known is the self. It's called solipsism.  Agile development was supposed to be the anti-solipsist process. It works best when it invites others to engage their mind and not merely document “all” the knowledge. Knowledge is just one step, and understanding is the next. As UX designers, don’t we invite thinking by framing the right questions in the proper context? We can know and understand the ideas of other people, even when those ideas aren’t fully articulated. Truth is objective, and it lives outside ourselves. We can apprehend it. Or, as Socrates said, “We should put the poets aside and converse directly with each other, testing the truth and our own ideas.” Arriving at opinions is each of our responsibility, and that is done best within a community others. This learning is adaptive to reality as you begin to understand changing facts. Agile development is seldom ever adaptive. Too often, it's practiced as a means to organize work into small chunks, and coerce developers into short run commitments. Scope increases, tech debt is never relieved, and agility only comes when the work stops cold.

Building with a team should leverage each person’s strengths and cover each person's weaknesses. Myopic execution is a grave problem with many organizations. It's often expressed as self-centered, indulgent or anemic, and baseless execution. In a word, it's solipsism. It happens when a team is marginalized into order takers, working away like cows at a salt lick. There's no excuse for it. A group of people working together have unimaginable potential.

Our philosophy is that work should honor personal contribution, and that contribution needs to be good for the community. Give people the space to direct their talents toward the good of others. Allow them to learn, and adapt. That's agile.
